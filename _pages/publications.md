University of California, Berkeley, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering <br/>
**Ongoing Project**: Collaborative Traffic Lights Control and Path Recommendations Using Reinforcement Learning
> * Built a city-scale simulation platform based on simulation of urban mobility (SUMO)
> * Proposed a traffic light control algorithm using deep Q-learning network (DQN) and Actor-to-critic (A2C) 
> * Proposed a real-time path recommendation algorithm for commuters using A2C 
> * Collaboratively trained two agents to minimize generalized system cost incorporating PM2.5 exposure
